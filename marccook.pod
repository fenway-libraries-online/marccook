=head1 NAME

marccook - the MARC record cookbook

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01 last modified 2016-05-05

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This cookbook contains a number of C<recipes> that you can use to filter,
modify, and otherwise manipulate MARC21 bibliographic, holdings, and authority
records.

Almost all of the recipes are for use at the command line; thus, they are
prefixed with the generic prompt C<$>:

    $ marcgrep +951 < foo.mrc

Some commands are listed with comments; these are not meant to be typed, thus
the following is equivalent:

    $ marcgrep +951 < foo.mrc  # Extract records with a 951 field
    
Occasionally, a recipe is a chunk of Perl code; when this is the case, the
first line will be the generic Perl hashbang line C<#!/usr/bin/perl>:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    # Fix record lengths
    $/ = "\x1d";
    while (<>) {
        substr($_, 0, 5) = sprintf '%05d', length;
        print;
    }

You may need to adjust this in order to adapt such recipes into your own
environment.

=head1 TOOLS

Nearly all of the scripts in this cookbook depend (either directly or
indirectly) upon the Perl module L<MARC::Loop>, available from CPAN at
L<https://metacpan.org/pod/MARC::Loop>.  Some of them are shell scripts; these
are all written in the Z shell and thus require L<zsh(1)>.  A few depend on
L<MARC::Record> and related modules.

=head1 BASICS

=head2 Count MARC records

To count MARC records, use L<marccount(1)>:

    $ marccount < foo.mrc  # Read records from standard input
    $ marccount foo.mrc    # Read records from a single file
    $ marccount *.mrc      # Read records from multiple files

By default, holdings records count toward the total.  To count B<groups> of
records, where each group is a bib record followed by zero or more holdings
records, use option B<-h>:

    $ marccount -h foo.mrc

=head2 Verify the validity of MARC records

L<marcdiag(1)> focuses mostly on the structural integrity of MARC records:

    $ marcdiag foo.mrc

Use option B<-s> to be stricter about what is considered an error:

    $ marcdiag -s foo.mrc

L<marclint(1)> takes a more high-level view, checking for semantic correctness
(e.g., every bib record must have a 245 field):

    $ marclint foo.mrc

Both tools generate a summary at the end.

=head2 View MARC records as plain text

To see a simple plain-text representation of a MARC record, use
L<marcdisasm(1)>:

    $ marcdisasm foo.mrc

Option B<-1> puts all of the subfields within a data field on a single line:

    $ marcdisasm -1 foo.mrc

=head2 View MARC records as fancy text

L<marchilite(1)> does something similar to L<marcdisasm(1)>, but with color goodness thrown in:

    $ marchilite foo.mrc

Most of the time, you will want to see record numbers but not count holdings records that follow a bib record:

    $ marchilite -n -h foo.mrc

=head2 View MARC records in a raw dump format

Sometimes, a record is so messed up that you need to see every byte to figure
out what is wrong with it.  L<marchex(1)> does that, and more, but its output
is very long so you will almost certainly want to pipe it through a pager such
as L<less(1)>:

    $ marchex foo.mrc | less

Showing record numbers and subfield identifiers may help you interpret the output:

    $ marchex -ns foo.mrc

=head2 View MARC records in a pager

By combining a MARC-to-text filter and a pager, you can easily browse through a
file of any size:

    $ marchilite foo.mrc | less -R

(Option B<-R> preserves color codes that L<less(1)> might otherwise strip.)

But of course there's a simpler way:

    $ marcless foo.mrc

If the record you want to look at is in Voyager, and you know its bib ID, then
it's a single command:

    $ vless 123

You can page through any number of bib records, and with option B<-H> you can
also see all of their MFHDs:

    $ vless -H 123 456 789

=head1 FILTERING RECORDS

The source of MARC records (e.g., C<< < foo.mrc >>) is not shown in these
examples.

=head2 Extract a range of records from a file

The first record:

    $ marcn 1

The first ten records:

    $ marcn 1-10

The last record:

    $ marcn n

=head2 Extract a bib and its MFHDs as a group

The first bib record and any MFHDs that immediately follow it:

    $ marcn -h 1

The first ten bib records with their MFHDs:

    $ marcn -h 1-10

=head2 Sample records from a file

Extract every tenth record:

    $ marcn '*/10'

Extract every 20th record, starting with the third record:

    $ marcn '*/20+3'

Extract records randomly, with each record having a 1% probability of being
printed:

    $ marcn -r 0.01

=head2 Extract bibs or MFHDs from an interleaved file

Given a file of interleaved bibs and MFHDs, there are all sorts of things you might need to do...

Drop all MFHDs:

    $ marc-drop-holdings

Drop MFHDs with location B<FLO-REVIEW> in the 852 field, subfield $b:

    $ marc-drop-holdings -d FLO-REVIEW

Drop all MFHDs B<except> those with a location B<FLO-REVIEW>:

    $ marc-drop-holdings -k FLO-REVIEW

Drop all bib records:

    $ marc-drop-bibs

Drop any bib records that are not followed by a MFHD:

    $ marc-drop-bare-bibs

=head2 Filter by the presence of absence of fields or subfields

Extract records that contain an 049 field:

    $ marcgrep +049

Extract records without an 049 field:

    $ marcgrep -v +049

Drop records with both a 100 field and a 110 field

    $ marcgrep +100 +110

Drop records with either a 100 field or a 110 field

    $ marcgrep -e +100 +110

Extract records that have more than one 245 field:

    $ marcgrep '#245 > 1'

Extract records whose 245 field has two or more of subfield $a:

    $ marcgrep '#245a > 1'

Extract records with fewer than five fields total:

    $ marcgrep -n '#(*) < 5'

=head2 Filter by the contents of fields and subfields

Extract records containing a particular string anywhere in the record:

    $ marcgrep -r Philadelphia

Extract records whose 001 field is C<abc123>:

    $ marcgrep '001 = abc123'

Extract records whose 245 field begins with C<The > (note the trailing space)
but has second indicator zero:

    $ marcgrep '245 ~ ^The ' '245:2 = 0'

Extract the first record whose title proper matches a particular regular expression

    $ marcgrep -1 '245a ~ war.*peace|peace.*war'

=head1 MODIFYING RECORDS

=head2 Edit MARC records

    $ marcedit foo.mrc

=head2 Edit MARC records in Voyager

The hard way:

    $ vget 123 4567 > foo.mrc
    $ marcedit foo.mrc
    $ vreplace foo.mrc

Or the easy way:

    $ vbibedit 123 4567
